        <p>Here is a quote from the Samoyed's Wikipedia page:</p>
         <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoyed_dog">
             Samoyed dogs are most often white, and can have a brown tint to their double-layer coat which is naturally dirt repellent. They are known to be used in expeditions in both Arctic and Antarctic regions and have a friendly and agreeable disposition.
